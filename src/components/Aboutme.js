        Hi, I'm in the Co-op Bachelor of Computer program at the University of Guelph, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.
        I'm currently searching for an internship for Summer 2021. I enjoy Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain. Check out my "Projects" page
        to see what I've been working on.
