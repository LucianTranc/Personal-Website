          <h2>About Communitech</h2>
          <p> 
            Communitech is a startup based in Waterloo that was founded in 1997 by a group of entreprenuerus who wanted to help tech-driven companies in Canada succeed.
            My time at Communitech was spent working with Digital Main Street on the Future Proofing Main Street program. You can read more
            about the program as a whole on Digital Main Street's <a href='https://digitalmainstreet.ca/futureproof/'>website</a>. 
          </p>
          <h2>Job Description</h2>
          <p> 
            I worked as a Web Designer in the Transformation Teams stream of the Future Proof program. The transformation teams consisted of
            a Copy Writer, Digital Marketer, UX/UI Designer, Graphic Designer and a Web Designer. My team was assigned businesses in 4-week sprints.
            Our goal was to identify and fix problems with the businesses online presence such as their website or social media. My task was more focused 
            on the client's website. Here is a list of the responsibilities I had:
          </p>
          <ul className="point-form">
            <li>
              Meet with clients to discuss their needs and issue they have with their website
            </li>
            <li>
              Create and test web applications and write website code
            </li>
            <li>
              Work with the UX/UI Designer to create website layouts and designs
            </li>
            <li>
              Work with CMS's like Shopify and Wordpress
            </li>
            <li>
              Fix bugs and other issues with client websites or hosting providers
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborate with Copy Writers and Graphic Designers on website content
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            With this being my first Co-op placement, it was a valuable experience working in a professional environment. Being able to 
            communicate directly with clients and leading the discussions during our initial consultations improved my confidence and my public speaking skills.
            The collaborative aspect of the Transformation Teams was also a great learning experience. Working in a team where each memeber had different skill sets
            was a little unorganized at first, but we soon became more comfortable with each other's strengths and got better at distributing the workload.
            Also, working in 4-week sprints helped me get accustomed to the pace of working in a professional setting. The structure of having daily check-ins 
            with the team, and weekly meetings with our supervisor allowed me to improve at setting short term goals.
            Furthermore, designing websites and writing code while knowing that the final product will be used by the business owner on a daily
            basis motivated me to imporve my workflow. Over the course of the work term, I became more diligent with details surrounding the websites and became more
            knowledgeable when it came to fixing issues and bugs. I was also given the opportunity to learn more about different CMS platforms like 
            Wordpress and Shopify. Finding solutions and workarounds through the limitations of each platform was one of the biggest challenges that I faced.
            However, working with the different platforms exposed me to each of their strengths and weaknesses, which allowed me to give better 
            recommendations to clients during our consultations. Lastly, working with Shopify introduced me to Shopify's templating language, Liquid. Learning and 
            applying Liquid to websites was a great way for me to expand my knowledge of different web development techniques. 

          </p>

          <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
          <p> 
            In order to take full advantage of the learning opportunity from each Co-op placement, my Co-op program recommended
            I come up with learning goals going into this job. These are my reflections on the areas of improvemnt I chose to focus on.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 1: Work on communication skills</h3>
          <p> 
            Working in a team environment was helpful towards my communication skills since it allowed me to collaborate with people that work in different disciplines, 
            and possessed different skills. Our team became better at creating realistic plans to help our clients because over the course of the term, I improved at 
            communicating the platform's limitations to my team, which gave us a better idea of what is possible to complete given our deadlines.
            Over the course of the term, we had several consultations with different businesses. The first couple of which, the conversation was led by my team, 
            and I mostly just chimed in with questions about their website. However over time, I became more comfortable with the consultations, and I asked if I 
            could be the one to lead the conversations with the businesses. Through the 4 consultations that I led, I improved my ability to deviate from the set of 
            questions we had prepared and improvised questions based on where the business owner was leading the conversation. This improved our groups understanding of 
            the needs of the business, and allowed us to better tailor our deliverables to suit their business.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 2: Practice writing clean and manageable code</h3>
          <p> 
            The type of work and responsibilities that came with this role didn’t perfectly line up with my expectations going in. I was expecting to work directly with 
            the code from the businesses websites, but since most of our clients were small businesses most of them relied on CMS’s for creating their websites. Most of 
            the technical work that came with this position had to do with either managing and making changes through the websites CMS, adding additional CSS code or writing 
            new sections using templating languages. As a result, my goal of writing manageable code for the business owners had to be redefined. What I had in mind when I came 
            up with that goal was making sure that the work I completed for the businesses was clear, clean, and easy for them to build upon in the future. Therefore, I applied 
            the idea behind my initial goal to the general development of each of the websites. When writing new theme templates for the Shopify sites, I made sure to follow consistent 
            naming schemes, use consistent code structure across sections, and keep theme sections separate to allow for the business owners to add to them in the future.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 3: Improve time management skills</h3>
          <p> 
            Setting realistic goals for the businesses was not only one of my initial learning goals, but my supervisor also stressed that it was important. My supervisor 
            wanted to make sure that our team wasn’t promising businesses a set of deliverables that we wouldn’t be able to manage. Because of this, I was encouraged to 
            practice laying out action plans detailing what we plan to provide for the businesses and by when. The plans included smaller incremental goals that the team agreed upon. 
            We set up action plans for each team member individually, and we held each other accountable in order to meet our deadlines. Also, working in 4-week sprints 
            helped me get accustomed to the pace of working in a professional setting. Having a deadline made me realize the importance of setting 
            small short-term goals in order to not get overwhelmed as deadlines approach.
          </p>

          <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
          <p>
            By the end of my time with Communitech I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to help 5 different small businesses
            with their websites. The businesses included hearing aid clinics, pet creamtion services, security services, personal artists and a bakery.
            The diversity of the projects broadened my understanding of website design and gave me the opportunity to work with different platforms.
            I am very proud of the work my team did for each of the business. I helped the businesses with website content, SEO, small optimizations and in one case,
            I was able to help a business start their Shopify site from scratch. 
          </p>
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p> 
            Overall I enjoyed my time working at Communitech. Helping small businesses was very fulfilling and it was a great learning experience.
            During my next Co-op placement, I hope to have the opportunity to further improve my public speaking, and get a chance to focus more on my
            techincal skills.
