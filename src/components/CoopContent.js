          <h2>About Communitech</h2>
          <p> 
            Established in 1997, Communitech is a Waterloo-based startup business that was founded by a group of entrepreneurs who wanted 
            to help tech-driven companies in Canada succeed. My time at Communitech was spent working with Digital Main Street in the Future 
            Proofing Main Street program. You can read more about the program as a whole on Digital Main Street's website.
          </p>
          <h2>Job Description</h2>
          <p> 
            I worked as a Web Designer in the Transformation Teams stream of the Future Proof program. Each transformation team consisted 
            of a Copywriter, Digital Marketer, UX/UI Designer, Graphic Designer and a Web Designer. My team was assigned businesses in 4-week 
            sprints. Our goal was to identify and fix problems with the business’s online presence such as their website or social media. My 
            task was more focused on the client's website.
            <br/><br/>
            Here is a list of the responsibilities I had:
          </p>
          <ul className="point-form">
            <li>
              Met with clients to discuss their needs and the issues they had with their website  
            </li>
            <li>
              Created and tested web applications and wrote website code
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with the UX/UI Designer to create website layouts and designs
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with CMS's like Shopify and WordPress
            </li>
            <li>
              Fixed bugs and other issues in the client websites or hosting providers
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with Copywriters and Graphic Designers on website content
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            With this being my first co-op placement, it was a valuable experience working in a professional environment. Being able to communicate 
            directly with clients and leading the discussions during our initial consultations improved my confidence and public speaking skills. 
            The collaborative aspect of the Transformation Teams was also a great learning experience. Working in a team where each member had different 
            skill sets was a little unorganized at first, but we soon became more comfortable with each other's strengths and got better at distributing 
            the workload. Additionally, working in 4-week sprints helped me get accustomed to the pace of working in a professional setting. The structure 
            of having daily check-ins with the team and weekly meetings with our supervisor allowed me to improve at setting short term goals. Furthermore, 
            designing websites and writing code while knowing that the final product will be used by the business owner on a daily basis motivated me to 
            improve my workflow. Over the course of the work term, I became more diligent about small details and I became more knowledgeable when it 
            came to fixing issues and bugs. I was also given the opportunity to learn more about different CMS platforms like WordPress and Shopify. 
            Finding solutions and workarounds through the limitations of each platform was one of the biggest challenges that I faced. However, working 
            with the different platforms exposed me to each of their strengths and weaknesses, which allowed me to give better recommendations to clients 
            during our consultations. Lastly, working with Shopify introduced me to Shopify's templating language, Liquid. Learning and applying Liquid to 
            websites was a great way for me to expand my knowledge of different web development techniques. Overall, the experiences made me more confident, 
            diligent, and gave me great web development experience.
          </p>

          <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
          <p> 
            In order to take full advantage of the learning opportunity from each co-op placement, my co-op program recommended I come up with learning goals 
            going into each job. These are my reflections on the areas of improvement I chose to focus on.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 1: Work on communication skills</h3>
          <p> 
            Working in a team environment allowed me to collaborate with people that work in different disciplines, and possessed different skills. This challenged 
            and helped improve my communication skills. Over the course of the term, I improved at communicating the platform's limitations to my team, which gave 
            us a better idea of what is possible to complete given our deadlines. This helped our team become better at creating realistic plans to help our clients. 
            Additionally, we had several consultations with different businesses throughout the term. The first couple of which the conversation was led by my team 
            and I mostly just chimed in with questions about their website. However, I became more comfortable with the consultations and I asked if I could be the 
            one to lead the conversations with the businesses. Through the 4 consultations that I led, I improved my ability to deviate from the set of questions we 
            had prepared and improvised questions based on where the business owner was leading the conversation. This improved our groups understanding of the needs 
            of the business and allowed us to better tailor our deliverables to suit their business.  
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 2: Practice writing clean and manageable code</h3>
          <p> 
            The type of work and responsibilities that came with this role didn’t perfectly line up with my expectations going in. I was expecting to work directly with
            the code from the businesses websites. But since most of our clients were small businesses, most of them relied on CMS’s for creating their websites. Most
            of the technical work that came with this position had to do with either managing and making changes through the websites CMS, adding additional CSS code
            or writing new sections using templating languages. As a result, my goal of writing manageable code for the business owners had to be redefined. What I had
            in mind when I came up with the goal was making sure that the work I completed for the businesses was clear, clean, and easy for them to build upon in the
            future. Therefore, I applied this idea to the general development of each of the websites. When writing new theme templates for the Shopify sites, I made
            sure to follow consistent naming schemes, use consistent code structure across sections, and keep theme sections separate to allow the business owners to
            add to them in the future.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 3: Improve time management skills</h3>
          <p> 
            Setting realistic goals for the businesses was not only one of my initial learning goals, but my supervisor also stressed that it was important. My supervisor
            wanted to make sure that our team wasn’t promising businesses a set of deliverables that we wouldn’t be able to manage. Because of this, I was encouraged to
            practice laying out action plans detailing what we plan to provide for the businesses and by when. The plans included smaller incremental goals that the team 
            agreed upon. We set up action plans for each team member individually and we held each other accountable in order to meet our deadlines. Also, working in 4-week 
            sprints helped me get accustomed to the pace of working in a professional setting. Having a deadline made me realize the importance of setting small short-term 
            goals in order to avoid getting overwhelmed as deadlines approach.
          </p>

          <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
          <p>
            By the end of my time with Communitech, I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to help 5 different small businesses with their websites. The businesses 
            included a hearing aid clinics, pet cremation service, security services, personal artists and bakery. The diversity of the projects broadened my understanding 
            of website design and gave me the opportunity to work with different platforms. I am very proud of the work my team did for each of the businesses. I helped the 
            businesses with website content, SEO, small optimizations and in one case, I was able to help a business fully develop a new Shopify site.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p> 
            Overall, I enjoyed my time working at Communitech. Helping small businesses was very fulfilling and a great learning experience. 
            During my next co-op placement, I hope to have the opportunity to further improve my public speaking and get a chance to focus on 
            growing my technical skills.
